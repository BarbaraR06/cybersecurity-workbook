In this activity, I investigated a website outage triggered by abnormal network traffic. Using packet capture analysis, I identified a high volume of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address, consistent with a SYN flood (DoS) attack. I documented how the attack impacts the TCP handshake, overwhelms server resources, and leads to connection timeouts for employees accessing the site. I also outlined immediate containment actions (taking the server offline temporarily and blocking the source IP) and noted limitations of IP blocking due to spoofing.
