In this activity, I investigated a website outage triggered by abnormal network traffic. Using packet capture analysis, I identified a high volume of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address, consistent with a SYN flood (DoS) attack. I documented how the attack impacts the TCP handshake, overwhelms server resources, and leads to connection timeouts for employees accessing the site. I also outlined immediate containment actions (taking the server offline temporarily and blocking the source IP) and noted limitations of IP blocking due to spoofing.


Cybersecurity Incident Report:
Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this network interruption
In this activity, I analyzed a server outage that affected employees of a travel agency, preventing them from accessing the company website due to connection timeout errors. After receiving an automatic alert from the monitoring system, network traffic was captured with a packet sniffer, revealing an unusual number of TCP SYN requests originating from an unknown IP address. Based on the traffic pattern and the server's lack of response, a SYN flood denial-of-service (DoS) attack was identified as the most likely cause.

A large number of TCP SYN requests were observed being sent to the web server from an unknown IP address. This pattern is typical of a SYN flood, where the attacker initiates numerous TCP connections without completing them, resulting in a saturated server unable to properly respond to legitimate requests, causing timeout errors when attempting to access the site.


Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction:
A SYN flood attack affects website functionality because it exploits the TCP three-way handshake process:
1. The client sends a SYN packet to initiate the connection.

2. The server responds with a SYN-ACK and reserves resources while waiting for confirmation.

3. The client should respond with an ACK to complete the connection.

In a SYN flood, the attacker sends many SYN packets but does not complete the handshake (does not send the final ACK). This generates many half-open connections. The server's connection queue fills up, consuming resources. This makes the server slow or inaccessible, and employees receive connection timeout errors when trying to access the website.

Attack Description:

The main symptoms observed are:
- A large number of repetitive SYN requests to the web server.

- An abnormal increase in incoming traffic from a suspicious source.

- Decreased or absent effective responses from the server to legitimate users.

- Connection timeout errors when attempting to access the site.

The devices involved in the disruption include the web server, the network firewall/router, and the attacker's device generating the SYN requests. The firewall may detect the increase in incoming requests, but without specific protection, the server will eventually become overloaded.

Negative Consequences for the Organization

Potential consequences include:

Website unavailability (loss of access to promotions and sales).

Disruption of work for employees who use the site to serve customers.

Loss of revenue and reputational damage due to service outages.

Increased workload for the technical team due to repeated incidents.

If the attack continues, it can lead to sustained degradation of server performance.

Measures to prevent similar attacks:
- Rate limiting and filtering of SYN traffic in the firewall.

- Enabling SYN cookies or anti-SYN flood protection on the server.

- Use of IDS/IPS to detect DoS patterns.

- Implementing anti-DDoS solutions.

- Continuous monitoring and alerts for abnormal connection volume.
